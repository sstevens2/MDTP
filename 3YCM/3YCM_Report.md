# Third Year Committee Report
Sarah Stevens, McMahon Lab  
Meeting: July 8th, 2015 in MSB 5503

## Research Progress
  Over the past year I have worked on tracking a set of thirty sequence-discrete populations from Trout Bog, as they are represented by genomes assembled from metagenomes(GFMs), using 63 metagenomes from 6 of years. I called single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and looked for genes gained or lost by the populations.  One genome showed a genome-wide sweep of diversity through the time series.  Other genomes show evidence of past gene-sweeps, regions of statistically significant low diversity.  From these results, we have propose that diversity within different co-occuring populations may be controlled by different mechanisms(recombintaiton vs. selection).  I currently have a manuscript submitted to ISMEJ on the results of this analysis.  
  I am also currently working on a manuscript concerning the population dynamics of the ubiquitous and abundant freshwater bacterium acI.  We have 14 single cell genomes(SAGs) from this clade, representing three lakes and five tribes.  We mapped reads from the Lake Mendota time series as 5 of the SAGs are from Lake Mendota.  In order to understand how these SAGs would map to one another, we shredded the genomes and mapped them against each other.  We found that SAGs from different tribes do not map well to each other.  In fact, even SAGs from the SAME tribe don't always map well to each other.  When we mapped reads from Lake Mendota to the SAGs, we found that SAGs from collected from different lakes showed a different distribution of identity among the hits.  This isn't surprising as the population represented by the SAG has diverged from the allopatric population present in Lake Mendota.   <!--- Something about the gene patterns through time and coverage differences -->  
  <!--- Section on the LD12's and population expansion etc.  Given that the populations we have looked at previously must be sequence-discrete in order to assemble, I want to look at other populations using a different setup, SAGs, fosmids...etc. -->
  <!--- Compare related populations between Trout Bog and Crystal Bog -->
